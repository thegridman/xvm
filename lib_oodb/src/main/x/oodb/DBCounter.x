/**
 * A database counter is a specialized form of a `DBValue` that is used to generate unique keys
 * or to count things in a highly concurrent manner. Unlike most database objects, a counter can be
 * used in an _extra-transactional_ manner, which is extremely useful for unique id (e.g. sequential
 * key) generation. When used correctly, a `DBCounter` can support extremely high levels of
 * concurrency by avoiding mixing reads and writes:
 *
 * * When a transactional `DBCounter` is used for read purposes, it does not block any other
 *   transactions that are reading xor writing the counter value;
 *
 * * When a transactional `DBCounter` is updated using a "blind" update (such as the [increment] and
 *   [decrement] methods), it does not block any other transactions that are similarly doing "blind"
 *   updates of the counter value, nor does it block any readers, because these updates are
 *   _composable_;
 *
 * * An extra-transactional `DBCounter` is designed to support high concurrency when generating new
 *   identities via the [next] method.
 *
 * In the case of an extra-transactional `DBCounter`, the database ensures that no two requests for
 * a [next] id will return the same value, regardless of whether they are in the same or separate
 * transactions, or even executing on different machines or in different data-centers. The counter
 * is stored persistently, such that the provided values will never be repeated for the lifetime of
 * the database, assuming the absence of unnatural events, such as a database restore from a backup
 * (or the counter value being explicitly set, e.g. to a previous value). Since this use of the
 * counter is a monotonically increasing function, it is possible for "holes" to appear in the
 * sequence of id's obtained from the counter for a variety of reasons. The Counter does not attempt
 * to prevent, identify, or reclaim these "holes". (A small exception to the "monotonically
 * increasing" rule is permitted to exist temporarily in a concurrent environment, such as in a
 * multi-threaded or distributed environment, in order to support more efficient concurrent
 * execution.)
