/**
 * The system "sys" schema that is always present under the root schema.
 *
 * Every Database automatically contains a `DBSchema` named "sys"; it is the database system's own
 * schema. (The top-level schema "sys" is a reserved name; it is an error to attempt to override,
 * replace, or augment the database system's schema.) A database implementation may expose as much
 * information as it desires via its schema, but there will always exist the following contents,
 * regardless of the database implementation:
 *
 * * `sys/info` - the [DBValue] containing the [DBInfo] value for this Database
 * * `sys/users` - a [DBMap] of user name to [DBUser]
 * * `sys/types` - a [DBList] of all distinct `Type` objects that are supported by the Database
 * * `sys/objects` - a [DBMap] of path to [DBObject]
 * * `sys/schemas` - a [DBMap] of path to [DBSchema]
 * * `sys/counters` - a [DBMap] of path to [DBCounter]
 * * `sys/values` - a [DBMap] of path to [DBValue] DBObjects
 * * `sys/maps` - a [DBMap] of path to [DBMap]
 * * `sys/lists` - a [DBMap] of path to [DBList]
 * * `sys/queues` - a [DBMap] of path to [DBQueue]
 * * `sys/processors` - a [DBMap] of path to [DBProcessor]
 * * `sys/logs` - a [DBMap] of path to [DBLog]
 * * `sys/pending` - a [DBList] ordered by scheduled invocation date/time of
 *   [Pending](DBProcessor.Pending) objects
 * * `sys/transactions` - a [DBLog] of [Transaction] objects
 * * `sys/errors` - a [DBLog] of errors REVIEW String
