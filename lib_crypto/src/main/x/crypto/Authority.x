/**
 * An Authority is a representation of _trust_. For example, when a `Certificate` is used to verify
 * a signature, who verifies the `Certificate`? Another `Certificate` (the next `Certificate` in the
 * "certificate chain") is used, and so on, but what about the top certificate in the chain, which
 * is self-signed and comes from a "CA" (Certificate Authority)? This interface represents the
 * answer to that question.
 *
 * Normally, the authority is delegated to the conceptual "host". On both the client and the server,
 * the host is _usually_ the operating system (from Apple, Microsoft, Google, or the provider of a
 * Linux distribution), but several notable exceptions exist: Mozilla (for the Firefox browser) and
 * Oracle (for the JVM in OpenJDK and many other Java distributions) maintain their own trust
 * authorization implementations and their own list of "root" certificates that are assumed to be
 * trustworthy.
 *
 * While it is possible (and inevitable) that this interface could be implemented entirely within
 * Ecstasy, and using a custom (or configurable) set of trusted roots, the general case is expected
 * to be that the `Authority` available by injection is likely to be one that delegates trust
 * decisions and verification to "the host".
