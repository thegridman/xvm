/**
 * A `Channel` provides the ability to read from a data source and/or write to a data destination.
 *
 * An important aspect of the `Channel`, which is a complicating factor in its design, is that it is
 * intended to provide support for non-blocking I/O operations. Specifically, the interface is
 * designed such that methods that might naturally block on I/O internally could instead return a
 * future, if the caller intends to perform the operation in a non-blocking manner.
 *
 * All information that is transmitted and received via a `Channel` is transferred through the API
 * in _buffers_. To write to the channel, a [ReadBuffer] is passed to the channel, with its contents
 * being the data to write. Similarly, to read from the channel, a [WriteBuffer] is passed to the
 * channel, and the channel will deposit contents into the buffer. While any `Channel` can work with
 * any `ReadBuffer` or `WriteBuffer` implementation from any [BufferProvider], each channel also
 * provides access to its own internal `BufferProvider`. It is _possible_ that using the channel's
 * own `BufferProvider` may eliminate an extra buffer copy; this approach is known as "zero copy
 * I/O", which is a misnomer -- zero-copy I/O is actually "one less copy I/O". Note that the
 * channel's own `BufferProvider` is likely limited in terms of its capacity; this is a natural
 * consequence of the possibility that the channel's own buffers represent a fixed resource, such
 * as the underlying process' or operating system's own buffers.
