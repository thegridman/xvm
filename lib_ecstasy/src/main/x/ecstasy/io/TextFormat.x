/**
 * A TextFormat represents the ability to convert between text data and objects. The act of creating

 * object to be stored (e.g. on disk) or transported (e.g. over a network). The purpose of
 * deserialization is to allow that information to be converted back into an object that is largely
 * indistinguishable from the original object from which that information was extracted.
