/**
 * The InputStream interface represents a bounded input stream of binary data. Unlike Channel, an
 * InputStream is **not** open-ended; it has a finite size, although that size may be significantly
 * larger would fit into a program's memory, and thus the interface supports underlying
 * implementations that can represent the entirety of the binary stream, while only having an
 * arbitrarily small portion of it memory-resident.
 *
 * By its nature, an InputStream has a knowable length, a current position, and it is _seekable_.
 * That means that the position within the stream can be modified -- in either direction.
