/**
 * A BinaryFormat represents the ability to convert between binary data (a stream of bytes) and
 * objects. The act of creating binary data from an object is called _serialization_. The act of
 * creating an object from binary data is called _deserialization_. The purpose of serialization is
 * to allow the information from an object to be stored (e.g. on disk) or transported (e.g. over a
 * network). The purpose of deserialization is to allow that information to be converted back into
 * an object that is largely indistinguishable from the original object from which that information
 * was extracted.
