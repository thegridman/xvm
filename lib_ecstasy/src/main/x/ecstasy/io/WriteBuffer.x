/**
 * A WriteBuffer represents the formation of a _transferable_ holder of binary data. Its contents
 * are read/write, until the buffer is _flipped_ into a ReadBuffer, at which point the WriteBuffer
 * is no longer usable.
 *
 * In addition to binary stream-based data access, the WriteBuffer also allows random access to data
 * within the buffer.
 *
 * Conceptually, a buffer provides mutual exclusion, in terms of its ownership: At any point, at
 * most one service should be writing to and/or reading from a buffer. Indeed, that is the very
 * purpose for a buffer to exist: It holds a deposit from a writer until that deposit can be
 * extracted by a reader. With respect to efficiency, it is extremely important that a region of
 * memory not be modified by more than one actor (thread, CPU core, bus device) at a time (i.e.
 * within some period of time that any one actor is modifying the memory), because doing so will
 * cause CPU cache flushes, CPU cache invalidation, memory bus contention, and so on, and may even
 * allow for unpredictable outcomes due to concurrent updates. Furthermore, if any actor is
 * modifying a region of memory, no other actor should be reading from that region of memory, or the
 * read performance will drop dramatically. (Conceptually, multiple actors can read from a region of
 * memory concurrently without contention; it is the presence of any writer that mandates the mutual
 * exclusion principle.)
 *
 * In Ecstasy, a buffer is modeled as if it were a service, which means that it _conceptually_
 * behaves independently of (and asynchronously with respect to) any and all readers and writers.
 * However, it is expected that any intrinsic implementations of I/O buffers will be synchronous,
 * and that the buffer data will be treated as if it were located within the memory space of the
 * service writing to and/or reading from the buffer. In other words, while the buffer implies a
 * mutual exclusion contract, an intrinsic implementation may restructure the manner in which the
 * contract is enforced while a buffer is actually being used by a particular service. The primary
 * reason for this is to "lift" the validity and range checks from inside of hot I/O loops, while
 * simultaneously allowing buffers to be re-used repeatedly, while .
