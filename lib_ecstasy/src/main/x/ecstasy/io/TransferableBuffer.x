/**
 * TransferableBuffer represents a transferable holder for an array of bytes. As such, it is
 * implemented as a service, so that it can be reached from different services. The objects that
 * are actually crossing the service boundaries are the const inner classes ReadBuffer and
 * WriteBuffer, which have no mutable state of their own, but which delegate their operations to a
 * hidden implementation class, [ActualBuffer], that is part of (hidden inside of) the service.
 *
 * There is an exclusive access contract for the buffer; it is enforced by strictly invalidating a
 * buffer when either its lifecycle reaches closure, or when a new ReadBuffer or WriteBuffer is
 * created (since the new instance would then have exclusive access). This prevents an old reference
 * (to either a ReadBuffer or a WriteBuffer) to be held and later used to access the data in the
 * underlying buffer, which would represent a security risk. Additionally, the exclusive access is
 * _from_ the context of a particular service; in other words, when a ReadBuffer or WriteBuffer is
 * used from a service, that will be the only service that the buffer will be permitted to be used
 * from. While this contract may seem unnecessarily rigid, it represents the purpose of the buffer,
 * which is to provide an abstraction that can be efficiently written-to within one service, and
 * then subsequently read-from in another service. Regarding efficiency, the implementation as
 * provided here is correct and reasonable, but it is necessarily inefficient, because the Ecstasy
 * language does not provide explicit language support for the concept of exclusive access when
 * references are passed across service boundaries. It is expected that an implementation of the
 * Ecstasy runtime would provide an intrinsic implementation of this service that adheres to the
 * specified contracts, while minimizing the implied costs of (i) the buffer's service boundary
 * and (ii) the creation of one-time-use proxy references.
