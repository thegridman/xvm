/**
 * A natural hasher uses the object's own hash code and the relational equality operator associated

 * The purpose of the NaturalHasher class is to allow an implementation of a hashed data structure
 * to easily switch between working with objects that provide their own hashing and equality, and
 * with objects whose hashing and equality is known (or overloaded) by a separate implementation.
