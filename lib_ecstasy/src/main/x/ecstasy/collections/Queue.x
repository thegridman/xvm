/**
 * A Queue is a representation of elements in a queue, including the potential for elements that
 * will eventually arrive in that queue.
 *
 * Queue supports both demand-based and inversion-of-control (event-based) programming models:
 *
 * * The [next] method allows a caller to test for the presence of an element in the queue, and
 *   to take the first element if the queue contains any elements.
 * * The [take] method allows a caller to take the first element in the queue, or to wait for that
 *   first element to arrive (if there are currently no elements in the queue).
 * * The [pipeNext] method allows a caller to direct the first element in the queue (or the next
 *   element to arrive if the queue is currently empty) to be routed ("piped") to a particular
 *   consumer.
 * * The [pipeAll] method allows a caller to direct all elements in the queue, including those
 *   that will be enqueued in the future, to be routed ("piped") to a particular consumer.
 *
 * In the case of the `take` method, the result can be obtained as an asynchronous `@Future` value,
 * allowing for reactive-style or continuation-based handling. This allows a caller to build its
 * logic in a non-blocking manner. Similarly, the `pipe*` methods are used for an event-driven
 * programming model; however, the `@Future` approach has the benefit of a standard model for
 * dealing with cross-service invocation, continuations, and exception handling (e.g. an exception
 * indicating that the Queue was closed).
