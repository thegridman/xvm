/**
 * This class represents the capabilities that are common to every Ecstasy object. This class is the
 * single inheritance root for the Ecstasy type system; in other words, "everything is an object",
 * and every object is "of a class" that extends this Object class.
 *
 * An object is reachable through a reference, and an object reference **always** includes the
 * public portion of Object.
 *
 * Additional meta-information about the object is available through:
 * * The reference to the object, represented by the {@link Ref} interface;
 * * The {@link Type} of the object reference, which is provided by {@link Ref.Referent} and
 *   {@link Ref.actualType}; and
 * * The {@link Class} of the object, which is accessible via the Type, unless the type has been
 *   masked by {@link Ref.maskAs<AsType>()}.
