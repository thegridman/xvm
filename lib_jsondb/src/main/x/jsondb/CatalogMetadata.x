/**
 * This mixin provides metadata about the catalog of a specific database to the `jsonDB` database
 * engine. The various methods and properties of the mixin are almost always implemented by a code
 * generation process that the `jsonDB` database engine uses, when it prepares a database module
 * (any Ecstasy module that incorporates [oodb.Database] and contains a schema) for hosting.
 *
 * The information provided by this mixin allows the `jsonDB` database engine to bootstrap the
 * database from nothing (i.e. creating the database in persistent storage), and to open an existing
 * database that was previous created.
 *
 * The basis for the information provided by a generated CatalogMetadata is a database definition
 * (aka "DDL"), which is often loosely referred to as a database _schema_. The `oodb` library, of
 * which `jsonDB` is an implementation, uses an Ecstasy module as the representation of a database
 * definition. The `jsonDB` library contains tooling that produces source code for a module that
 * binds the DDL to the `jsonDB` database implementation.
